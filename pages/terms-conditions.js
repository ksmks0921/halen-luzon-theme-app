              <p>
                You are responsible for obtaining the data network access
                necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and
                messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the
                Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for
                acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary
                to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates
                thereto. Halen does not guarantee that the Services, or any
                portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or
                devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to
                malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and
                electronic communications.
              </p>

              <h3>Payment</h3>
              <p>
                You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to
                you for the services or goods you receive from a Third-Party
                Provider ("Charges"). After you have received services or goods
                obtained through your use of the Service, Halen will facilitate
                your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the
                Third-Party Provider, as such Third-Party Provider's limited
                payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner
                shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to
                the Third-Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of
                applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are
                final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Halen.
                You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third-Party
                Provider for services or goods received by you from such
                Third-Party Provider at the time you receive such services or
                goods. Halen will respond accordingly to any request from a
                Third-Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular
                service or good.
              </p>
              <p>
                All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated
                by Halen using the preferred payment method designated in your
                Account, after which Halen will send you a receipt by email. If
                your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired,
                invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that
                Halen may, as the Third-Party Provider's limited payment
                collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your
                Account, if available.
              </p>
              <p>
                As between you and Halen, Halen reserves the right to establish,
                remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods
                obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Halen’s
                sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges
                applicable in certain geographical areas may increase
                substantially during times of high demand. Halen will use
                reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply,
                provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under
                your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the
                amounts thereof. Halen may from time to time provide certain
                users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in
                different amounts charged for the same or similar services or
                goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree
                that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made
                available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the
                Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel
                your request for services or goods from a Third-Party Provider
                at any time prior to such Third-Party Provider's arrival, in
                which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the
                Third-Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Except
                with respect to taxicab transportation services requested
                through the Application, Halen does not designate any portion of
                your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third-Party Provider.
                Any representation by Halen (on Halen’s website, in the
                Application, or in Halen’s marketing materials) to the effect
                that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included"
                in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not
                intended to suggest that Halen provides any additional amounts,
                beyond those described above, to the Third-Party Provider. You
                understand and agree that, while you are free to provide
                additional payment as a gratuity to any Third-Party Provider who
                provides you with services or goods obtained through the
                Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are
                voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained
                through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your
                experience and leave additional feedback about your Third-Party
                Provider.
              </p>

              <h3>Repair or Cleaning Fee</h3>
              <p>
                You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to,
                or necessary cleaning of, Third-Party Provider vehicles and
                property resulting from use of the Services under your Account
                in excess of normal "wear and tear" damages and necessary
                cleaning ("Repair or Cleaning"). In the event that a Third-Party
                Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such
                Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Halen in Halen’s
                reasonable discretion, Halen reserves the right to facilitate
                payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on
                behalf of the Third-Party Provider using your payment method
                designated in your Account. Such amounts will be transferred by
                Halen to the applicable Third-Party Provider and are
                non-refundable.
              </p>

              <h3>Arbitration</h3>
              <p>
                the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
                thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes")
                will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Halen ,
                except that each party retains the right to bring an individual
                action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or
                other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
                prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation
                or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
                patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge
                and agree that you and Halen are each waiving the right to a
                trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any
                purported class action or representative proceeding. Further,
                unless both you and Halen otherwise agree in writing, the
                arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and
                may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
                representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
                unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution"
                section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding
                sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any
                termination of these Terms.
              </p>

              <h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
              <p>
                The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
                Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial
                Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
                Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as
                modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules
                are available at https://www.adr.org/aaa-panel by calling the
                AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern
                the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
              </p>

              <h3>Arbitration Location And Procedure</h3>
              <p>
                Unless you and Halen otherwise agree, the arbitration will be
                conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not
                exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on
                the basis of documents you and Halen submit to the arbitrator,
                unless you request a hearing, or the arbitrator determines that
                a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your
                right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject
                to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to
                direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties,
                consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
              </p>

              <h3>Arbitrator's Decision</h3>
              <p>
                The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame
                specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will
                include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
                arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award
                may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
                arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of
                the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and
                the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The
                arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
                favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
                provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If
                you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of
                attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under
                applicable law. Halen will not seek, and hereby waives all
                rights Halen may have under applicable law to recover,
                attorneys' fees and expenses if Halen prevail in arbitration.
              </p>

              <h3>Fees</h3>
              <p>
                Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and
                arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
                However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000,
                Halen will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that
                either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your
                Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an
                improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
                Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
              </p>

              <h3>Changes</h3>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related
                provisions above, if Halen changes this "Dispute Resolution"

                In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name
                and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this
                "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are

                Halen in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute
                Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these
                Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
